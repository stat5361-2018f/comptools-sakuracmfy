### My Computer System

```{r echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```


### Problem 1

If Build window warning 
```
missing Loadname() 'package name'
```
just use the code
```
install.packages("package_name")
```
Sometimes the package is not available in RStudio. Just google it and follow the process in relevant github web page.



### Problem 2 

If Build window warning missing "pandoc" or "XQuartz", go to the website shown in the warning and install it.



### Problem 3

If your Console warns "unknown timezone" or something relevant, you need to go https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ and install R 3.5.1.



### Problem 4

If Build window shown warning of missing font style, just google it, then download and install it.



### Problem 5

If the _main.pdf has been created and these words are shown in Build window,
```
Output created: _book/_main.pdf
Warning messages:

2: The label(s) functional-arguments not found
